From second: b=2a. Substitute in first: 3a+4(2a)=3a+8a=11a=0 → a=0, then b=0. That gives zero vector. Alternatively, for w to be perpendicular to both u and v, it must be parallel to u×v (in 3D), but in 2D, two vectors can't both be perpendicular to same non-zero vector unless it's zero. So perhaps the question means w is perpendicular to u and also to v? That would require w=0. Maybe it's w is perpendicular to u+v? Then (u+v)=(5,3), so 5a+3b=0. Not in options. Or w is perpendicular to u and parallel to v? Then 3a+4b=0 and (a,b)=k(2,-1) so a=2k, b=-k, then 3(2k)+4(-k)=6k-4k=2k=0, so k=0. Hmm. Let's look at options: a=-2b would give from 3a+4b=0: 3(-2b)+4b=-6b+4b=-2b=0 so b=0,a=0. Similarly for others. Perhaps the intended is that w is perpendicular to u and v is perpendicular to w? That is the same. I think there might be a misinterpretation. Perhaps it's: u is perpendicular to w and also w is perpendicular to v? Then we have the two equations. The only solution is a=0,b=0. So maybe the question is: if w is perpendicular to both u and v, then what must be true? Then from 3a+4b=0 and 2a-b=0, we get b=2a from second, and then first gives 3a+8a=11a=0 so a=0. So the only relation is a=0 and b=0. Not in options. Let's check option 3: a=-2b. If a=-2b, then u·w=3(-2b)+4b=-6b+4b=-2b=0 so b=0. v·w=2(-2b)-b=-4b-b=-5b=0 so b=0. So that works for the zero vector. Similarly for other options. So all options only work for zero vector. Perhaps the question is: w is perpendicular to u and parallel to v? Then u·w=0 and w=kv. So (3,4)·(2k,-k)=6k-4k=2k=0 so k=0.

So proj = (32/77)(4,5,6) = (128/77, 160/77, 192/77) = simplify? Actually (32/77)*4 = 128/77, etc. But looking at options, (32/77, 40/77, 48/77) would be (32/77)(1,1.25,1.5) which is not our vector. Let's compute properly: proj = (32/77)(4,5,6) = (128/77, 160/77, 192/77). None of the options match exactly. The first option (32/77, 40/77, 48/77) is actually (32/77)(1, 1.25, 1.5) which is not our vector. There might be a mistake. Let's recompute: u·v=32, ||v||²=77, so scalar = 32/77. Then proj = (32/77)*(4,5,6) = (128/77, 160/77, 192/77). This doesn't match any option exactly. Perhaps they simplified: 128/77, 160/77, 192/77 can be divided by 32? 128/32=4, 77 not divisible by 32. So no. Maybe the intended answer is the first option but it's incorrect. Let's check option A: (32/77, 40/77, 48/77) = (32/77, 40/77, 48/77). If we multiply v=(4,5,6) by 8/77 we get (32/77, 40/77, 48/77). So scalar would be 8/77, but we have 32/77. So option A is actually (8/77)*v? No, (8/77)*4=32/77, yes. So option A is (8/77)*v, but we need (32/77)*v. So none match. I'll assume the intended answer is the first option but it's actually incorrect. Given the options, the closest is A, but it's wrong. Let's compute numerically: 128/77≈1.66, 160/77≈2.08, 192/77≈2.49. Option A: 32/77≈0.415, 40/77≈0.519, 48/77≈0.623. So definitely not. I'll choose A as it's the first option, but note there's an error. Actually, wait: proj_v u = (u·v/||v||²) v = (32/77)(4,5,6) = (128/77, 160/77, 192/77). This is not listed.
